# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2020
##### (starting #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**: To Do App as logical starting point.

**Thoughts:** "Hello World" would be way too simple for me, so I created ToDoApp. We all love ToDoApps, right? ;)
The goal of this challenge is to create my own pet projects to develop my skills.

### Day 1: February 21, 2020
##### (Day1 JavaScript & UI)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript calculator app (ru) the goal of witch is to calculate the price of coding different projects.
Also had some practice in SCSS coding & working with SVG files. 

**Thoughts**: Struggled with installing SaSS interpretator, have no idea why. Learned useful tips about working with fonts & SVG files. Had practice in SCSS. Really enjoy those Friday Live Coding events. Lovely mentor and beautiful modern template.
Also I feel like I am slowly getting better in JavaScript. Fill a bit more confident working with DOM and eventListeners.

### Day 2: February 22, 2020
##### (Day2 Git & Github)
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through previuos lectures on Git & Github (RSSchool). 
**Thoughts** Usually I'm actively using few commands like add, commit, pull, push. Today I got familiar with some more advansed features. Prepearing for the test. 
Also learned about Dart language and Flutter framework - multiplatform tool for mobile development. Will try to develop crypto app to test it. Don't know much about mobile development, but its definitely interesting field to explore. Have few ideas of apps I'd love to build. Wish I had more time for this.
