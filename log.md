# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2020
##### (starting #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**: To Do App as logical starting point.

**Thoughts:** "Hello World" would be way too simple for me, so I created ToDoApp. We all love ToDoApps, right? ;)
The goal of this challenge is to create my own pet projects to develop my skills. 

**Link to work:** [ToDo App](https://github.com/NatalyCoding/ToDoList1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
